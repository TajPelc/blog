      <description><![CDATA[<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class="spaced-contents"><p>Here is a mistake that a lot of companies make. They fail to understand how to treat their tech team right and it causes churn, low quality code and constant firefighting. And that can kill a business.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice to have a team of programmers who are motivated, proactive and you can trust to have your back?</p><p>The failure usually comes from misunderstanding of basic needs. Programmers are not some mythical beasts that you need to feed a high sugar diet, unlimited amounts of free soda and provide with plenty of entertainment in exchange for the magic source code that they write late at night.</p><p>What you actually need to do is provide them with <strong>purpose</strong>, <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>autonomy</strong>.</p><p>But how does that work?</p><p>First, transparency goes a long way. If they understand the objective of the company and they identify with the mission, they will be more likely to pull the cart in the same direction.</p><p>Have regular briefings to let them know what the priorities are and why they are like that.</p><p>Then you want to build a culture of autonomy. If your tech team know what the objective is, instead of giving them granular tasks, give them autonomy to address the issue in the best way they can come up with.</p><p>To do that you need trust going both ways. You need to trust that the tech team will deliver on your objective and they need to trust you that you know what you are doing with the business.</p><p>And that trust is built a bit at a time.</p><p>So should you go and throw your existing processes out the window?</p><p>No.</p><p>I’m saying to ask your tech team how well they understand the direction of the company and the mission. Make it specific. Focus on the next quarter.</p><p>If you get any uncertainty, sit down and explain. Even if they say they understand. You need to make their eyes glow, that’s the key.</p><p>And next, besides the regularly scheduled time, give them some time to come up with their own solutions.</p><p>Let me know how it went. What kind of improvement did you see by implementing this in your company?</p><p>​</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Taj</p><p>Crafted in Berlin with &lt;3</p></div>]]></description>

      <title>5 principles to ship your MVP faster</title>
      <link>https://daily.pelc.cc/posts/5-principles-to-ship-your-mvp-faster</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class="spaced-contents"><h3>#1 Perfect is the enemy of good</h3><p>You are passionate about your idea and you want to make the best impression. However, making it perfect on the first try is impossible. Instead, make a conscious choice to ship it before you feel it’s ready.</p><h3>#2 Build to learn</h3><p>The key word in MVP is the minimum viable product. How do you make it viable? You want to learn what is valuable to your users and what they would pay for. Build the most efficient version and get real feedback. Iterate.</p><h3>#3 Put engineering in service of product</h3><p>Engineers love to work on the bleeding edge, using the latest technologies. Sometimes crude and non-sexy is the better approach to test something fast. Make sure engineering understands that. The time for cool implementations will come, but it’s most likely not on day one, unless your product is the technology itself.</p><h3>#4 Don’t build it at all</h3><p>Let’s say you want to test your product idea. Is there a way to test that does not require any engineering effort? Can you achieve the same with a questionnaire, interview, email? This is the fastest way to move closer to the MVP. And the closer you are, the more you focus on engineering. Because at that point, your solution is what uniquely provides the value.</p><h3>#5 Overengineering</h3><p>You imagine your product in the hands of millions of users and start building it in a scalable way, using all the hyped tech. It costs a ton of engineering effort = burns money. Make something people want, iterate fast, scale later. Just invest enough not to back yourself into a corner.</p><p><em>​</em><a href="www.pelc.cc/blog/5-principlesto-ship-your-mvp-faster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>view in browser</em></a><em>​</em></p></div>]]></description>

      <title>The mistake that almost cost Bob his business</title>
      <link>https://daily.pelc.cc/posts/the-mistake-that-almost-cost-bob-his-business</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class="spaced-contents"><p>Bob had a startup idea. He was really passionate about it. The kind of passion that keeps you up at night. He opened a company and went to a famous web development agency to build his first prototype.</p><p>It was a typical agency project, a bit late, a bit over budget, a bit buggy. But in a couple of months Bob had something that he could show to potential investors and the customers. Some customers liked it, they were buying products. Numbers started to show.</p><p>It was good enough. For a start.</p><p>Bob got some investment money, hired a few developers, a designer, a product person and they began building on top of that prototype.</p><p>Progress was slow. It was difficult to build new features. The code was copy-pasted from one page to another as the startup wanted to experiment fast.</p><p>So Bob hired more tech people. They created even more code. They copy pasted code left and right. One file had over 3000 lines of code. That&#x27;s bad. Real bad.</p><p>Occasionally some customers would be overcharged. Sometimes, they would not be charged at all.</p><p>Bob had to employ more people in customer support.</p><p>Christmas approached and business seemed to be going real good. They nailed a campaing, leads were converting. Bob wanted to build more features, so he was hiring. Product people. Marketing people. The team grew. They all wanted features.</p><p>The tech team was barely floating. The backlog was a mile long. Marketing was waiting for their tracking pixels for weeks. Tech debt was growing ever bigger, until eventually no new features could be shipped.</p><p>All capacity was spent only on keeping the lights on.</p><p>Bob was furious. How could this happen? How incompetent is my tech team he asked!</p><p>... now this reads like fiction, but there are a few Bobs that I know personally.</p><p>The things is; you don&#x27;t end up in hell by suddenly dropping through the floor. The road there is long and twisted. If you make a wrong turn at every intersection it eventually gets real hot and there&#x27;s no time to backtrack.</p><p>Bob&#x27;s fundamental mistake was not having an experienced technical lead to  challenge his assumptions. To oversee the agency work. To keep the tech team on track. To hire great tech people and grow them. To challenge requirements. To mindfully create tech debt and set aside time to pay it off week by week.</p><p>Bob did his best. But his best was just not good enough.</p></div>]]></description>

      <title>Growing the tech team from 10 to 20 engineers can kill your tech department.</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class="spaced-contents"><p>Growing from 10 to 20 engineers can kill your tech department. Let me explain.<br/>​<br/>When the team is small you don&#x27;t need many processes. You only need that your people hang out and talk to each other. It&#x27;s intimate. There is a feeling of shared purpose. A new joiner talks to everyone before the team decides if he is a good fit.<br/>​<br/>Let&#x27;s say the business is successful and the backlog of features is growing. You probably took on some tech debt to ship the first versions, but nobody has time to tackle it now.<br/>​<br/>You need more people - and you can afford them. So it&#x27;s time to hire, right?<br/>​<br/>Not so fast.<br/>​<br/>Just adding people without a plan is a recipe for disaster.<br/>​<br/>You need to be prepared to change the structure of the tech organization and introduce processes, and new ways of working.<br/>​<br/>It&#x27;s going to be difficult. People will resist this change. You need to create a new way for people to have a shared sense of purpose and intimacy under the new structure.<br/>​<br/>I&#x27;ll go into more detail on strategies that you can employ in the next email tomorrow.<br/>​</p></div>]]></description>

      <title>What SpaceX can teach us about complexity</title>
      <link>https://daily.pelc.cc/posts/what-spacex-can-teach-us-about-complexity</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class="spaced-contents"><p>​</p><table width="100%" border="0" cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" style="table-layout:fixed" class="email-image"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><figure style="display:block;margin:6px 0;max-width:100%;width:800px"><div style="display:block;max-width:800px"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/k2aM1VfesqAEfpFxUTfiaz/quYbBD1jiPkYdywr51Eody/email" alt="SpaceX Raptor Engine" width="800" style="width:800px;max-width:100%;border-radius:13px"/></div><figcaption style="text-align:center;display:none">​</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Simple is hard. You may think the right engine came first. And then, SpaceX added a few features. But you&#x27;d be wrong.<br/>​<br/>The Raptor is the first modern full-flow staged-combustion-cycle engine. The benefit of this cycle is that no oxidizer or fuel is wasted. That gives you maximal theoretical performance.<br/>​<br/>But to get it to work, you must have your oxidizer and fuel turbines in a delicate balance. It&#x27;s incredibly complex to pull it off reliably.<br/>​<br/>How does this relate to software engineering?<br/>​<br/>Let&#x27;s start with a challenging problem. The solution you will come up with initially will not be ideal. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be. The goal is to make it work first. You take on some tech debt, and you end up with something that has a lot of moving parts. It works, but reliability and uptime suffer.<br/>​<br/>Any one of those parts is a potential failure point. And that increases your costs. It&#x27;s a pain to maintain. But you learned a lot through the process of building it.<br/>​<br/>Do you know what your next step should be? You refactor it. You consolidate. You remove what does not need to be there. Pay off the tech debt.<br/>​<br/>You iterate.<br/>​<br/>And eventually, you will arrive at the design on the right. Clean. Streamlined. With fewer moving parts. Higher reliability.<br/>​<br/>It&#x27;s magnificent when we can come up with simple solutions to complex problems.</p></div>]]></description>

      <title>The strongest predictor of team success</title>
      <link>https://daily.pelc.cc/posts/the-strongest-predictor-of-team-success</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 12:54:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class="spaced-contents"><p>By taking ownership and defining clear responsibilities, you can tap into the befit of having a small team. What do I mean?</p><p>According to the state of DevOps report, one of the strongest predictors of success for a team is its ability to make decisions and progress without the need to coordinate or ask permission from people outside the group.</p><p>That means sharing many responsibilities between a small number of team members. This is normal and required for the team to move fast. Problems arise when it needs to be made clear who owns a particular responsibility. That may lead to what I call the &quot;not in my job description&quot; attitude.</p><p>Let&#x27;s say you have a small development team. To make progress, all these responsibilities need to be covered by the members:</p><ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span>Architecture</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>UX / UI</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Dev</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Test</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Release</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Support</span></li></ul><p>Even in well-oiled teams, the last point is where they most often fail:</p><ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span>It&#x27;s Thursday morning. The internet at the office is down. The CI/CD server is offline. Who&#x27;s responsible for fixing it?</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>It&#x27;s Sunday evening. The production server is slow. Users are complaining. The database shows a high CPU load. Who&#x27;s responsible for fixing it?</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>It&#x27;s deployment day. One of the team members&#x27; computers dies. The motherboard failed. Who&#x27;s responsible for ordering a replacement? Do we have a backup?</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>...</span></li></ul><p>Each of those problems needs to be solved for the team to keep progressing. In poor-performing groups, issues like that are passed around like hot potatoes. It&#x27;s in nobody&#x27;s job description. Progress stalls as people need to coordinate. Or reach out outside their team for support. Then wait.</p><p>Well-performing teams recognize the importance of solving these issues fast. And they assign responsibilities to team members accordingly.</p><p>It&#x27;s only possible to predict some scenarios and prepare for a limited number of eventualities. It would be inefficient to try to anticipate them all. Yet when something happens once, the second time around should come as no surprise to anyone. That&#x27;s what makes the difference.</p></div>]]></description>

Most companies go through this phase.</p><p class="">Successful companies figure out how to turn it around.</p><p class="">Here is the framework:</p><p class="">First, you must relieve the tech team from having to jump on &quot;urgent&quot; tasks. Cut, streamline, and let a few fires burn. 🔥</p><ol class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Get uber-efficient at customer support. </strong>Document common issues and create blueprints. Add an on-duty rotation. Increase the tech team&#x27;s knowledge. Find bottlenecks between customer support and tech.</span></li><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Align the tech team with the goals of other departments. </strong>Marketing needs a landing page, a new campaign, and analytics exports. Find out what they need. How often. Create a process around it. Make it smooth. Do the same for accounting, logistics, etc.</span></li><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Start managing your tech debt. </strong>Tech debt is a tool. But too much of it can slash your progress. Manage it. No full rewrites. Be pragmatic about how to add new functionality.</span></li></ol><p class="">If you do that well, you just <strong>carved out time </strong>for the tech team to work on <strong>strategically important</strong> initiatives.</p><ol class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Get good at CEO &lt;&gt; CTO alignment around business goals. </strong>Those are your north stars and help you motivate the tech team by sharing them with the team.</span></li><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Improve collaboration with the product team. </strong>Now that you&#x27;ve carved out some time to work on strategic stuff, you need to find what is worth moving into development. Ideally, it is supported by numbers.</span></li><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Start leaning on data. </strong>The tech team has an incredible amount of data at their disposal. That is solid gold you can mine to boost CLTV or drive more sales. It&#x27;s tech&#x27;s job to enable other departments to tap into that resource.</span></li></ol><p class="">If this sounds like a lot, it is. But it&#x27;s also an evolution over time as you slowly get better. I&#x27;ve seen big improvements in the company&#x27;s adoption of these practices.</p><p class=""><em>The thing is...</em></p><p class="">It&#x27;s not just the tech team that needs to improve; it can also be a driver of change.</p><p class="">The role of the CTO is to translate from business to tech. Then, shape the tech team and define interfaces for other departments to work with them efficiently.</p><p class="">Plus, it&#x27;s time to break down the silos if your structure looks like this: all programmers in the same box, all marketers in the same box, and all product teams in the same box.</p><p class="">Creating cross-functional teams that can go from idea to production will run circles around the ping-ponging silo structure any day of the week.</p><p class="">Have a fantastic weekend,</p><p class="">Taj</p><p class=""><em>P.S.

And let&#x27;s hope Bob doesn&#x27;t quit even though he&#x27;s burned out.<br/>​<br/>Bus Factor: 🚌🔥 (1)<br/>​<br/>This is a terrible situation.

I guess Alice is working overtime this weekend without any help.<br/>​<br/>How to fix this?<br/>↳ Transfer the ownership of subsystems to the team.<br/>↳ Cross-train people to be able to work on more subsystems.<br/>↳ Instead of assigning, let people pick and choose tasks (pull vs push).<br/>​<br/>Here is what we did with a CTO that I was mentoring.<br/>​<br/>We created an on-duty system where, during standard working hours, a pair of engineers would first clear all the reactive tasks—customer support requests, bugs, etc. 🫡<br/>​<br/>Those would inevitably touch different systems, forcing the engineering pair to learn how to work with, update, and deploy that system. The people with the best knowledge of that subsystem would support it.<br/>​<br/>In a few months of this rotation, every team member had at least a surface-level understanding of all the subsystems.<br/>↳ The knowledge in the team increased.<br/>↳ The team is more independent (they don&#x27;t need to be instructed on how to fix something).<br/>↳ The bus factor is no longer a problem. It&#x27;s a bus fleet. 🚍🚍🚍<br/>​<br/>Ultimately, we could cancel the on-duty system as it achieved the desired result.<br/>↳ Productivity went up.<br/>↳ People can help each other out.<br/>↳ Vacation and sick leave is possible.<br/>↳ Working on an actual team instead of a collection of soloists is more fun.<br/>​<br/>That&#x27;s the good stuff that I like to see.</p><p class="">Best regards,</p><p class="">Taj</p></td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>

Most projects I&#x27;ve been on have not been on the bleeding edge of computer science. Though I&#x27;m no stranger to using modern approaches, it&#x27;s mostly been best practices and proven tech to solve a specific problem for a specific audience.</p><p class="">The tools are the same. What matters is how you apply them to the project at hand.</p><p class="">That said, figuring out what you should build is much more difficult.</p><p class="">When you know the what, the how is usually simple.</p><p class=""><strong>Business rarely understands tech. Tech usually ignores business.</strong></p><p class="">Different incentives. Different skills. Different mindset.</p><p class="">To be a good engineering leader, you need to know both sides. And you need to be able to bring the business side closer to the developers.</p><p class="">The job of the software engineer is not to write code. It&#x27;s to solve a problem for the customer. Yes, that often includes some code or automation.</p><p class="">But code is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p><p class=""><strong>Siloses will form naturally because like attracts like. You need to actively design your organizational structure to achieve the desired effect.</strong></p><p class="">Backend/Fronted and Product/Engineering are terrible split points, but plenty of companies do this.</p><p class="">I would not recommend it.</p><p class="">How you design your organization will have a massive impact on the way things are done.</p><p class="">Often, the best way to improve performance is not by implementing better processes.</p><p class="">It&#x27;s by changing the organizational structure and communication. The rest will fit into place.</p><p class="">Yours,</p><p class="">Taj</p></td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>

      <title>Two problems of Engineering Management</title>

        }
     }</style><table cellPadding="0" cellSpacing="0" style="width:100%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td><p class="">When you&#x27;re a fresh developer, you get access to software engineering books, courses, and a senior who scrutinizes every line of code you write. You learn. You improve. Until someday, you get to pester some poor noob who doesn&#x27;t know where to put his semicolons.</p><p class="">After a few years of pestering others, you get promoted to a team lead. Congratulations! 🎉</p><p class="">The problem is, no one gives you a brief on how to do that. There are no courses, no stack of books, and no seniors to pester you.</p><p class="">You&#x27;re on your own.</p><p class="">Before you come at me with pitchforks, a select few companies have a structured training course for leadership. A rare few.</p><p class="">Being left alone means that many people in the company&#x27;s mid-tier don&#x27;t know how to lead — they only learn how to manage.</p><p class="">That&#x27;s the first problem. Ineffective middle management can make any company feel like hell, especially if you have a very strategic top leadership who talks big vision.</p><p class="">But not every fresh engineering manager is as complacent. Some are passionate about their new position. They attend tech leadership courses, read books, and find mentors.</p><p class="">This leads me to the second problem: you&#x27;re just important enough to be strategic but not enough to actually make a significant change.</p><p class="">So, if the top leadership doesn&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s hell for you anyway.</p><p class="">What can you do, sandwiched in the middle of the company?</p><p class="">You can learn to lead and improve the lives of those around you—your team, your peers, and the people.</p><p class=""><strong>Be a leader you wish you had and lead up the chain of command.</strong></p><p class="">That&#x27;s a tough job to do. In a big company, it&#x27;s easiest to be a grunt. You do what you&#x27;re told, don&#x27;t complain, and get paid.</p><p class="">But if you step up that ladder, be prepared to be a shield and to lift others up. Tough, but ultimately rewarding work.</p><p class="">Yours,</p><p class="">Taj </p></td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>
